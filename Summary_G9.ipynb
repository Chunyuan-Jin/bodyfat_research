    "In both of our methods, we find that ABDOMEN is the most important variable among 14 predictors. WEIGHT ranks high in both methods comparing with other variables. WRIST is significant in linear stepwise model and ADIPOSITY scores high in nonlinear model. Considering the rule of thumb, we select ABDOMEN as our first variable in predicting body fat. Also, to increase the accuracy we choose another variable among WRIST, WEIGHT, ADIPOSITY as our second variable. The number of predictors are too small to use any tree model or ensemble method in machine learning. We still choose normal linear regression as our model. The colinearity are not significant between two variables, so we may not add regulization to our model. After comparing three models, we choose ABDOMEN and WEIGHT as our predictors, because it has highest R-square 0.72."
